# Entity and complex type reference | Graph API reference 

    
 _**Applies to:** Graph API | Azure Active Directory_


<a id="Overview"> </a>
This topic discusses the entities and complex types that are exposed by the Graph API.

The Graph API is an OData 3.0 compliant REST API that provides programmatic access to directory objects in Azure Active Directory, such as users, groups, organizational contacts, and applications. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure AD Graph API functionality is also available through [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/), a unified API that also includes APIs from other Microsoft services like Outlook, OneDrive, OneNote, Planner, and Office Graph, all accessed through a single endpoint with a single access token.

## Entity reference

### Application Entity <a id="ApplicationEntity"> </a>
Represents an application. Any application that outsources authentication to Azure AD must be registered in a directory. This involves telling Azure AD about your application, including the URL where it's located, the URL to send replies after authentication, the URI to identify your application, and more.  For more information, see [Basics of Registering an Application in Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-scenarios/#basics-of-registering-an-application-in-azure-ad). Inherits from [DirectoryObject].

### Contact Entity <a id="ContactEntity"> </a>
Represents an organizational contact. Inherits from [DirectoryObject].

Organizational contacts represent users that are not in your company directory. They are mail-enabled entities and typically represent individuals who are external to your company or organization. Organizational contacts cannot be authenticated using Azure AD, nor can they be assigned licenses. 

Organizational contacts can be created in your tenant through syncing with an on-premises directory using Azure AD Connect, or they can be created through one of the Exchange Online management portals or the Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets. For more information about Azure AD Connect, see [Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-aadconnect/). For more information about Exchange Online management tools, see [Exchange Online Setup and Administration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-administration-and-management.aspx#BKMK_ExchangeAdministrationCenter). 

You cannot create organizational contacts with the Graph API. You can, however, update and delete contacts that are not currently synced from an on-premises directory; that is, contacts for which the **dirSyncEnabled** property is **null** or **false**. You cannot update or delete contacts for which the **dirSyncEnabled** property is **true**.

**Note**: Organizational contacts are directory entities, which represent external users. They should not be confused with O365 Outlook Personal contacts.

**Note:** Not all navigation properties are necessarily valid on the entity types that inherit from **DirectoryObject**. If a request for a property that is not valid for a specific entity is sent, a **400 Bad Request** response is returned. For more information about which navigation properties are valid on specific entities, consult the documentation for that entity type. 

#### Supported Operations
The full set of operations that are supported on directory objects are the following (the HTTP method used for each is in parentheses): Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PATCH), and Delete (DELETE). However, not all of these operations are supported on every entity type. The declared properties of directory object are read-only; they cannot be specified in create or update operations.

The potential set of operations supported on each of the navigation properties are: 

- **createdObjects**: Read (GET).
- **createdOnBehalfOf**: Read (GET).
- **manager**: Read (GET), Update (PUT), and Delete (DELETE).
- **directReports**: Read (GET). 
- **members**: Read (GET), Update (POST), and Delete (DELETE).
- **memberOf**: Read (GET).
- **ownedObjects**: Read (GET).
- **owners**: Read (GET), Update (POST), and Delete (DELETE).

Not all navigation properties are necessarily supported on every entity type, nor are the set of potential operations for a navigation property necessarily supported on every entity type.

Whether a particular directory object supports a particular action or function, depends on the type of the directory object (the **objectType** property). For information about which object types support which functions or actions, see the documentation of the particular object, for example, user, group, etc., or of a particular function.

Consult the documentation for the specific entity type for information about operations supported for an entity.

Represents an Azure AD directory role. Azure AD directory roles are also known as *administrator roles*. For more information about directory (administrator) roles, see [Assigning administrator roles in Azure AD](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-assign-admin-roles/).

With the Graph API, you can assign users and service principals to directory roles to grant them the permissions of the target role. You can read directory role objects and update the **members** navigation property of directory roles, but you cannot delete directory roles or update their declared properties. Inherits from [DirectoryObject]. 

To read a directory role or update its members, it must first be activated in the tenant. In versions prior to 1.5, all directory roles are activated by default. Beginning with version 1.5, only the **Company Administrators** directory role is activated by default. To activate other available directory roles you send a POST request with the **objectId** of the [DirectoryRoleTemplate] on which the directory role is based. See **Supported Operations** and **Remarks** for more information.

**Important**: Beginning with version 1.5, the **Role** entity type is renamed to **DirectoryRole**.

| description | Edm.String | No | Yes | The description for the directory role. |
| displayName | Edm.String | No | Yes | The display name for the directory role.  |
| isSystem | Edm.Boolean | No | Yes | **true** if the role is a system role; otherwise, **false**.  |
| objectId | Edm.String | No | Yes | The unique identifier for the directory role. Inherited from [DirectoryObject].<br/><br/> **Notes**: **key**, immutable, not nullable, unique.  |
| objectType | Edm.String | No | Yes | A string that identifies the object type. For directory roles the value is always "DirectoryRole". Inherited from [DirectoryObject].<br/><br/> **Note**: In versions prior to 1.5, the value will be "Role".  |
| roleDisabled | Edm.Boolean | No | Yes | **true** if the directory role is disabled; otherwise, **false**.  |
| roleTemplateId | String | Required | Yes |  The **objectId** of the [DirectoryRoleTemplate] that this role is based on. <br/><br/> **Notes**: In versions prior to version 1.5, the property is read only. In version 1.5 and later, the property must be specified when activating a directory role in a tenant with a POST operation. After the directory role has been activated, the property is read only.  |

| members | \* | [DirectoryObject]<br/><br/> ([User] and [ServicePrincipal] are supported. | \* | Users and service principals that are members of this directory role. Inherited from [DirectoryObject].<br/><br/> HTTP Methods: GET, POST, DELETE |

**Note:** Inherited navigation properties that are not listed are not supported. Requests addressed to unsupported navigation properties return **400 Bad Request**. 

#### Supported Operations
The following operations are supported on directory roles (the HTTP method used for each is in parentheses): 

- Create (POST): Supported in version 1.5 and later. Activates a directory role in the tenant using the [DirectoryRoleTemplate] specified by the **roleTemplateId** property in the request. After the directory role is activated, you can add and delete users and service principals from the role.
- Read (GET)

The following operations are supported on directory role navigation properties: 

- Read (GET)
- Update (POST)
- Delete (DELETE)

No functions or actions may be called on directory roles; however, you can call [getMemberObjects] on a [User] or [ServicePrincipal] to determine its directory role memberships. Note that for users, this function also returns its direct and transitive group memberships.

#### Remarks
- In version 1.5 and later, only the **Company Adminstrators** role is activated (and visible) in a tenant by default. Use the Create (POST) operation to activate additional directory roles. The operation specifies the **roleTemplateId** property in the request. This property contains the **objectId** of the [DirectoryRoleTemplate] instance that corresponds to the role you want to activate. After the directory role is activated you can add and delete users and service principals from it with the Graph API. In versions prior to 1.5, all directory roles (represented by the **Role** entity) are activated by default and the Create (POST) operation is not supported.
- Directory roles cannot be deleted using the Graph API. Updates are supported on the **members** navigation property only. Both add and remove are supported on this property.
- Query filter expressions are not supported on directory roles.

### DirectoryRoleTemplate Entity <a id="DirectoryRoleTemplateEntity"> </a>
Represents a directory role template. A directory role template specifies the property values of a directory role ([DirectoryRole]). There is an associated directory role template object for each of the directory roles that may be activated in a tenant. Inherits from [DirectoryObject].

To read a directory role or update its members, it must first be activated in the tenant. In versions prior to 1.5, all directory roles are activated by default. Beginning with version 1.5, only the **Company Administrators** directory role is activated by default. To activate other available directory roles you send a POST request to the /directoryRoles endpoint with the **objectId** of the directory role template on which the directory role is based specified in the **roleTemplateId** parameter of the request. For more information, see [DirectoryRole].

**Note**: A directory role template is exposed for the **Users** directory role. The **Users** directory role is implicit and is not visible to directory clients. Every [User] in the tenant is assigned to this role by the infrastructure. The role is already activated. Do not use this template.

**Important**: Introduced in version 1.5.

- Create (POST): Supported only for security groups.
- Read (GET): Supported for all groups.
- Update (PATCH): Supported only for security groups and mail-enabled security groups. Not all properties can be updated.
- Delete (DELETE): Supported only for security groups.

The following operations are supported on group navigation properties: 

- Read (GET): Supported for all groups.
- Update (POST): Supported only for security groups and mail-enabled security groups. (members and owners only.)
- Delete (DELETE): Supported only for security groups. (members and owners only.)

The following actions and functions may be called on groups:

- [checkMemberGroups] to check a group’s membership in a list of groups. The check is transitive.
- [getAvailableExtensionProperties] to return a list of the extension properties that have been registered for a group. Requires version 1.5 or newer.
- [getMemberGroups] to return a list of the groups that a group is a member of. The check is transitive.
- [isMemberOf] to check whether a group is a member of a specified group. The check is transitive.

#### Remarks

- There are three kinds of groups: mail distribution groups (**mailEnabled** property **true** and **securityEnabled** property **false**); mail-enabled security groups (**mailEnabled** property **true** and **securityEnabled** property **true**); and, (pure) security groups (**mailEnabled** property **false** and **securityEnabled** property **true**).
- You can only create security groups using the Graph API (you cannot create mail-enabled security groups or mail distribution groups). For this reason the **mailEnabled** property must be set **false** and the **securityEnabled** property must be set **true** when creating a group.
- All properties marked required must be specified when creating a security group using the Graph API. These properties are: **displayName**, **mailNickname**, **mailEnabled** (**false**), **securityEnabled** (**true**).

#### Supported Operations
The following operations are supported on users (the HTTP method used for each is in parentheses): 

- Create (POST)
- Read (GET)
- Update (PATCH)
- Delete (DELETE)

The following operations are supported on user navigation properties; not all operations are supported on every navigation property.

- Read (GET)
- Update (PUT)
- Delete (DELETE)

The following actions and functions may be called on users:

- [assignLicense] to assign and/or remove a specified list of licenses from a user. Requires version 2013-11-08 or newer.
- [checkMemberGroups] to check the user’s membership in a list of groups. The check is transitive.
- [getAvailableExtensionProperties] to return a list of the extension properties that have been registered for a user. Requires version 1.5 or newer.
- [getMemberGroups] to return a list of the groups that a user is a member of. The check is transitive.

- [isMemberOf] to check whether a user is a member of a specified group. The check is transitive.

####Remarks

- At a minimum, you must specify the following properties when creating a user: **accountEnabled**, **displayName**, **mailNickname**, **passwordProfile**, and **userPrincipalName**. The password specified in the **passwordProfile** property must meet the tenant’s password complexity requirements. For more information, see the **passwordPolicies** property.
- In version 2013-11-08 and newer, the **immutableId** property must be specified when creating a new user account in the Graph if you are using a federated domain for the user’s **userPrincipalName** (UPN) property.
- The **displayName** property cannot be cleared on updates.
- The **passwordProfile** property always returns **null**. This is to prevent the user’s password from being displayed. You can reset the user’s password by updating the **passwordProfile** property.
- In addition to the standard addressing available for all directory entities, users may be addressed by using the **userPrincipalName** property; for example, `https://graph.windows.net/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/users/john@contoso.onmicrosoft.com?api-version=1.5`.
